# 🧠 Pandas Concepts for Data Engineers

As a **Senior Data Engineer**, you should go beyond basic Pandas usage to cover data profiling, cleaning, transformation, and prototype data preparation.

---

## ✅ Core Pandas Topics for Data Engineers

### 🧱 1. DataFrame & Series Basics
- Creating DataFrames from different sources (CSV, JSON, Excel, SQL, Parquet)
- Understanding Series vs DataFrame
- Setting and resetting index
- Checking memory usage and optimizing data types (`df.info()`, `astype()`, `categorical`)

---

### 🔄 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Handling missing values (`isnull()`, `fillna()`, `dropna()`)
- Handling duplicates (`duplicated()`, `drop_duplicates()`)
- String operations (`str.lower()`, `str.replace()`, regex-based cleaning)
- Date/time conversion (`pd.to_datetime()`, handling time zones)

---

### 📊 3. Data Transformation
- Filtering rows and columns using boolean conditions
- Mapping and replacing values (`map()`, `replace()`, `applymap()`)
- Applying custom functions (`apply()`, lambda functions, vectorized ops)
- Binning and discretization (`cut()`, `qcut()`)

---

### 🔀 4. Merging & Joining
- `merge()` (inner, outer, left, right joins)
- `concat()` (row-wise and column-wise)
- `join()` method for combining on index

---

### 📈 5. Aggregation & Grouping
- `groupby()` with multiple aggregations
- `agg()` and `transform()` for advanced use cases
- Multi-level grouping and sorting
- Pivot and pivot_table
- Rolling, expanding, and window functions

---

### 🗂️ 6. Working with Hierarchical (MultiIndex) Data
- Creating and using MultiIndex
- Selecting from MultiIndex
- Stacking and unstacking
- Reshaping with `melt()`, `pivot()`

---

### ⏱️ 7. Time Series Handling
- Time-based indexing and slicing
- Resampling (`resample()` for downsampling/upsampling)
- Rolling averages and time-based groupby
- Handling holidays and business days

---

### 🧪 8. Data Quality and Profiling
- Summary stats (`describe()`, `value_counts()`)
- Uniqueness checks
- Data validation (e.g., using `assert`, `np.where`, etc.)
- Anomaly/outlier detection

---

### 🧮 9. Performance Optimization
- Vectorized operations over loops
- Memory usage reduction (convert `object` to `category`)
- Use of `query()`, `eval()` for large DataFrames
- Chunk-based reading with `pd.read_csv(..., chunksize=...)` for big files

---

### 📁 10. File I/O and Integration
- Reading from and writing to:
  - CSV, Excel, Parquet, JSON
  - SQL databases (`read_sql`, `to_sql`)
- Working with S3/DBFS/local path hybrid in cloud platforms like Databricks
- Compression and chunked processing for large files

---

## 💼 Bonus for Real-world Data Engineers

### 🚀 Advanced & Applied
- Converting pandas logic to PySpark or SQL efficiently
- Using pandas for prototyping before scaling in Spark
- Building small ETL workflows in pandas (e.g., in Glue scripts or data prep tasks)
- Writing unit tests for pandas transformations using `pytest`
- Logging and debugging pandas steps in ETL pipelines
